Problem Statement: Real-Time Battery Health Monitoring for Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Electric vehicle (EV) batteries degrade over time due to factors like charging cycles, temperature variations, and driving patterns. Without real-time monitoring, users and fleet operators may face unexpected failures, reduced performance, and higher maintenance costs.

A real-time battery health monitoring system is needed to:

Continuously track battery parameters (voltage, temperature, charge cycles, etc.).

Predict battery degradation and potential failures.

Optimize charging and discharging cycles for longer battery life.

Provide alerts and diagnostics for preventive maintenance
